## Read me if you want to write a tutorial for our b.Board IDE. 
**Objective:** Explain how to write tutorials in the *markdown* with enough detail to make it painfully easy. 

**A couple of notes before we begin:** 

These instructions will guide you through how to create a tutorial rather than a whole-screen, *MakeCode Activities* that appear at the top of the IDE window.

# STEP 1
**Plan + Create your assets!** I've only completed this process twice, and I can tell you that often words are not enough to explain the user's task. Your tutorial can contain text, images (JPGs only) and .gifs. Your workflow to create these assets may be different but let's say I want to include an overhead image of our bBoard and a gif to show a hookup. **Create these first and store them in a folder somewhere on your computer before sitting down to write the text for your tutorial**.

### Here is my workflow for creating image / gif assets: 
|  IMAGE  |  GIF  |
|--|--|
|Edit image on computer.  |Record short <5s video, or, |
|Export image as .jpg  |Edit video to be <5s & export.|
|Create [temp] folder on computer. |Use .gif service like giphy.com|
||Save to same [temp] folder.

Now that you are motivated by all of your fancy artwork that you have created for your tutorial, its time to host them on GitHub so our talented Web Developers can actually find your assets. **You may want to follow your own version of the next step.**

# STEP 2
**Navigating GitHub** If you are reading this, it is assumed that you have already joined the main Brilliant-Labs repo. If you need help with this, please reach out to Jeff. Once you have navigated your browser to our [main repo](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs) click on **bboard-tuts**.

**Create a New Folder for your Tutorial** This is where GitHub may start to intimidate - *but you've got this.* Let's break this down into steps: 

 1. Click on **Create new file**![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.30.58%20PM.png?raw=)
 2. In the field shown in the image below you will now create both a folder, and a README.md file that will be used to store the text and code your tutorial will require to run. Your tutorial's name should follow something like: bboard-tuts/**new_tutorial/README.md**. Everything in bold you will have to type. Please remember to name your tutorial something relevant. As soon as you type your forward slash, GitHub will assume you want a new folder inside the bboard-tuts repo and change that heading to blue. Also, the README.md is case-sensitive. USE CAPS. ![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.31.34%20PM.png?raw=)![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.31.58%20PM.png?raw=)![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.32.10%20PM.png?raw=)
 3. Scroll down and click **Commit new file**. 
 4. Now you are ready to upload your image and .gif files to this folder. Click Upload Files. ![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.33.09%20PM.png?raw=)
 5. Drag and drop or select the files you want to upload from your computer. Scroll down and click **Commit changes.** 
 6. Once the page reloads, you will be taken back to the main folder of the **bboard-tuts** repo. You can check to see if your files are in the new folder by clicking on said folder. You should see something like the image below. ![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.34.02%20PM.png?raw=)![enter image description here](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/bboard-tutorials-v3/blob/master/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-17%20at%2012.48.57%20PM.png?raw=)
 7. If you see all of your assets, you are done this step.
