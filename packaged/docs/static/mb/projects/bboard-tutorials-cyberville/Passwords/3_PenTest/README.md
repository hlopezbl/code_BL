# Penetration Test

Perform a penetration test in the schoolâ€˜s web infrastructure to see potential problems and to find potential malware that could have been installed.  If you find anything, you will have to identify the source of the problem, rectify the situation and prevent this situation from appearing again.  You will have to produce a Cybersecurity Assessment Report that identifies the problems observed, your solutions and your recommendations to fix these issues.
