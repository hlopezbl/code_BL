## Description Mission 1
### Mission 1: Weird Lights at School
Cyberville has a traditional K to 12 school with a student population of 350 students.  The building is standard and uses some components of the Internet of Things (IoT) like heat control and automatic lighting to work during normal school hours and to be closed at night.  These lights can also be controlled remotely by a supervisor working at the government building.  To save money, the school also controls heat and conditioning air with a remote-controlled thermostat from the government building (5).

Recently, some reports have been sent to the supervisor about heat and light-related problems.  For example, one day the temperature in some classrooms went up without notice and was so uncomfortable that students and teachers had to leave the classroom.  Some events included lights flashing in the gymnasium and intermittent blinking in the school cafeteria.  Also, the number of phishing emails and spamming mail has increased.  Last week, Internet access was interrupted for a day.  Students and teachers couldnâ€™t go on the Web for that period.
